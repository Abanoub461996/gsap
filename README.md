This is a showcase expressing my skills in ThreeJs and GSAP animation.
You Can Simply see the App on the run her :
`https://abanoub461996.github.io/gsap/`

## Technologies & dependencies.

This is a React Project created using Vite, and it depends mainly on ThreeJs and GSAP libraries applying the animations required.

## Run The App.

after getting your version of the code from our github repo, u can run the app for development using `npm run dev`.

## App Detailed Discreption.

This App is not by any chance a work of art, as the Design and Content Creation is far away from being my area of expertise and designing animation requires a lot of creativity I never claim to have.

Yet, in this App You will be able to see:

### 1. GSAP

#### Horizontal navigation.

in the navbar anchors, navigation triggers the horizontal scroll by GSAP.

#### Horizontal Scroll Triggers.

scrolling your way in the app, the scroll after the hero Section will be horizontally for 3 sections before it gets back to the verticall scroll again in the footer section.

#### Text Animation in Scroll.

Scrolling your way through the application almost all text used in the app will be animated based on the scroll.

### 2. THREEJS

#### Morphing 3D Shapes.

in the final seection using ThreeJs and through scrolling the the shape is being morphed from a box shape to a sphere and I allowed the controls to see the 3 dimentions using the mouse click and drag.
